/**
 As the foundation of the SayKit stack, the `SAYConversationManager` class integrates application-wide interfaces for audio track coordination, voice request presentation, and verbal command availability.
 
 The provided `systemManager` should be the only instance of this class needed for the vast majority of applications.
 
 ## Audio Source Configuration
 
 The `SAYConversationManager` conforms to the `SAYAudioEventListener` protocol, sending any audio event sequences from its registered sources to their respective tracks for audio production. To enable this connection, a source must be explicitly added to a manager (and connected to one of the tracks supported by it's track coordinator). This is configuration is often done during app initialization. For more details, see the documentation for `SAYAudioEventSource` and `SAYAudioTrackCoordinator`.
 
 The `trackCoordinator` on the application-wide `systemManager` is preconfigured with two tracks: the "main" and "voice request" track. The "main" track is intended for typical application speech and the "voice request" track is intended for audio out during voice requests (i.e. prompts and microphone activation sounds). These two tracks can be referenced with the string constants `SAYAudioTrackMainIdentifier` and `SAYAudioTrackVoiceRequestIdentifier`, respectively.
 
 ## Voice Command Configuration

 To support voice commands, applications must explicitly set the manager's `commandRegistry`. This collaborator is tasked with being the central authority on available voice commands. See the documentation for the `SAYVerbalCommandRegistry` protocol for more details.
