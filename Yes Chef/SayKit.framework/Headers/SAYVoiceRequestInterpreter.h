/**
 *  The `SAYVoiceRequestInterpreter` protocol describes a class capable of transforming the raw results of speech recognition into a more useful form for the application to use. This higher-level form is encapsulated in a `SAYInterpretation`, which holds the result as well as other relevant data discovered during the interpretation process.
 
    For example, an interpreter might be tasked with classify speech as either having a "yes" or "no" intent, transforming the text into a boolean value stored inside the `SAYInterpretation`. If the user speech has no clear intent, the interpretation could instead hold a validation error describing the reason no intent could be interpreted.
